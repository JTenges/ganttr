Ganttr uses data from a simple JSON request to design the chart. The JSON should be in the format of:

<pre>
  {:boxes => [
      {:start_date => "Nov 3, 2009", :end_date => "Nov 12, 2009", :label => "ASDF", :resource => "MD"},
      {:start_date => "Nov 5, 2009", :end_date => "Nov 17, 2009", :label => "Working?", :resource => "GM"},
      {:start_date => "Nov 15, 2009", :end_date => "Nov 23, 2009", :label => "Whoa...", :resource => "TM"}
    ],
    :arrows => [
      {:from => 0, :to => [1,2]},
      {:from => 1, :to => 2}
    ]}.to_json
</pre>

A handful of configuration options can be changed at the top of ganttr.js to suit your needs.

To load the chart just call @loadChart();@ from a click event, page load, whatever.
